    <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
    <p>I always had an interest in tech since I was a child. I would watch tech reviews on youtube and read them on gsmarena and the likes. My Tech journey started in 2019 where I worked in the media unit of my church. There, I learnt the basics of how a computer works and how to operate one. I also got a laptop (more like a desktop with low specs). In the same year I got admission to study Computer Engineering in the University of Benin (which I still regret). I was advised then to pick up a coding skill then,as it would help me in school. So I decided to learn C and C++ which was still complex at the time so I abandoned it. In January of 2020 I resumed University and after 2 months Covid happened.</p>
    <p>In 2020, I worked in a laptop repair shop, where I learnt the internal structure of a computer and how to solve many PC problems. In the same year, I also had a youtube channel where I occassionally dropped animated videos from time to time (this was inspired by storytime animators I usually watched on youtube like Alex Clark, Odd1sout, Domics and my ex-classmate who was also a youtuber at the time) I also gave up on that after some months. And then, my phone got stolen.</p>
    <p>After my phone got stolen, I don't know what clicked in my brain but I suddenly became interested in game development. It became a passion that wouldn't die. So I researched how to make a game, downloaded alot of game engines (Unity, Game maker, Construct3, Gdevelop5, Godot etc.) and tutorials from youtube (brackeys and such), also downloaded games to learn how a game should behave. It was then I fell in love with rpg and open world games but alas my computer could only do so much.</p>
    <p>In January of 2021 I went back to school, my drive for game development was still there but I was lazy and had recently discovered Anime in 2020 so I left game development for a while but it was still at the back of my mind. Fast forward to the beginning of 2022 and I got a chromebook and that was the beginning of my web dev journey. The plan was to make some money from web dev to sponsor my game development ambition. And so it began.</p>
    <p>It all began with Sam's teach yourself web development (Html, css and Javascript), there I learnt Html4, css and Javascript then went on upwork, created a profile and started sending proposals. Suprise suprise you need more than just the fundamentals to get a Job and so I entered youtube and began my research and that's where I discovered that the more you think you know, the less you know. So currently I have the following skills in my repertoire Html, css, Javascript, reactjs, angularjs(learnt it before realising it's been replaced with Angular) and Git. Though I had to relearn the fundamentals because sam's book was outdated. I am currently still in school learning more languages to complete my fullstack journey accompanied with C, C#(The Game dev was meant to be) and Java for my software development journey which I'm learning in school.</p>
    <p>I've learnt a lot and still have a lot to learn. I'll update this page as time goes on. Thanks for reading.</p>
