Good day to you. My name is Etinosa Samuel Otoghile also known as aregular guy and code name aguycodes. I am currently a computer engineering student in a university I would like to leave anonymous. Anyway, I am an aspiring software engineer who will be versatile in the arts of Java, C# and C (Which I am currently been taught in school). But currently I am also an aspiring full stack developer (Aspiring meaning I'm like half way there).
